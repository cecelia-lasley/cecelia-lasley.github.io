      <h3>About the Internship</h3>
      <p>The Reference and Instruction Internship is one of two on-campus internships hosted by the Lawrence McKinley Gould Library.
      The internship serves as an opportunity for Carleton students to gain experience in academic reference, project management, marketing, among
      many other areas in support of the Reference and Instruction department. The internship is a 10-hour/week position for sophmores, juniors, and seniors.
      The internship is structured around readings about key concepts, such as the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy, and current issues in the field
      of academic librarianship,such as algorithmic bias and open access and scholarly publishing models; project work; providing reference services both
      at the reference desk and on local and global chat reference queues; and professional development opportunities. Cecelia had the opportunity to work as an intern during
      her junior and senior years.</p><br>
      <p class="copyrightStatement">Copyright for all of Cecelia's work as an intern is held by Carleton College. To learn more about the internship,
      please see either <a href="https://gouldguides.carleton.edu/interns" target="_blank">the Gould Library guide on library internships</a>

      <h3>Africana Studies LibGuide</h3>
      <p>This LibGuide was among Cecelia's first projects as an R&I intern, completed in the Fall of 2018 and early Winter of 2019. She worked with Reference and Instruction Librarian,
      Claudia Peterson, to update the guide and include more digital resources for useres. The guide has since been updated to include more information on primary sources.<br>

      <h3>Interview Project</h3>
      <p>This project was another of Cecelia's first projects as an R&I intern, and was completed during the Fall of 2018 and Winter of 2019. In order to learn more about the field
      of the librarianship, she intereviewed a majority of the librarians at Carleton, as well as librarians from the Northfield Public Library, St. Olaf College, Maryland State
      Legislative Library, Madison, WI Public Library, and McGill University. Questions ranged from their career path to their library school experience to their current positions to
      advice for those interested in becoming librarians in the future. Cecelia then synthesized the interviews into an article that was published on the R&I Internship blog.
      This project groudned Cecelia's future work as an intern and a MSLIS student in the rich context of these varied careers and experiences.</p>

      <h3>"Theater and Dance Department Records, 1977-2013" Finding Aid</h3>
      <p>This project was completed during the Winter and Spring of 2019. While the majority of Cecelia's time as a R&I intern was spent in the Reference and Instruction department,
      she and her co-intern were also allowed to explore other departments in which they were interested. Under the supervison of Carleton College Archivist, Tom Lamb, Cecelia processed,
      arranged, and described five boxes of papers from Ruth Wiener (Class of 1944 Professor of English, Theater and the Liberal Arts, Emerita), a longtime Carleton professor who
      helped found the the Theater and Dance department at Carleton. The rest of this colleciton remains unprocessed. This project was Cecelia's first exposure to archival practices
      and theories, particularly "Describing Archives: A Content Standard" (DACS) and "More Product Less Process" (MPLP). Cecelia was also able to gain expereince with archival reference
      during her time in the Carleton Archives.</p><br>

      <h3>Open Access Week Marketing</h3>
      <p>Cecelia completed this project in collabroation with Emika Otsuka, another R&I intern and member of the Carleton class of 2020, during Fall of 2019. This project was centered
      around Carleton's celebration of International Open Access Week. They designed digital signage for the library's TV focusing on the significance of Open Access both generally and
      at Carleton, designed stickers to give to students, researched Open Access in our major fields and presented our findings to our supervisors, Claudia Peterson
      and Emily Scharf, and co-wrote an article about Open Access for the library's website. This project was an exciting opportunity to engage with research on a contemporary library
      issue and communicate our findings with our peers on a large scale.</p>

      <h3>Primary Source LibGuide</h3>
      <p>This project was completed during the Fall of 2019. Cecelia designed and built this guide to support primary source learning across the Carleton cirriculum under the
      supervision of Reference and Instruction Librarain Claudia Peterson. To best accomplish this, Cecelia interviewed all of the R&I librarians as well as the government documents
      librarian to understand how their liasion departments defined the term "primary sources" and where students could start looking for primary sources in that subject. These
      interviews were synthesized into short paragraphs with links to relevant subject guides and 1-2 databases, if available, and were arranged by subject on the LibGuide.
      Cecelia co-wrote the definition for primary sources on the main page with Reference Librarians Claudia Peterson and Audrey Gunn. This guide was designed to serve as a tool for
      Carleton students and librarians navigating the nuances of primary sources between disciplines. This guide was an incredible learning opportunity for Cecelia as she was able
      to dive depper into primary source literacy and LibGuide design. Since its publication in early 2020, there have been minor edits to the guide and several staffing changes
      that have rendered small portions of the plain text inaccurate. However, the guide is otherwise as it was when it was originally published.</p><br>

      <h3>Special Collections Curation and Shadowing</h3>
      <p>This series of projects was another expereince outside of the Reference and Instruction department. Cecelia spent the Winter 2020 trimester working with and shadowing Special
      Collections librarian Rebecca Bramlett. She curated a display case exhibit on Publisher's Bindings, and co-curated a pop-up exhibit with Library Intern, Valarie Salazar. The
      pop-up exhibit, entitled "Lions, Tigers, and Rare Books, Oh My!: A Special Collections Pop-Up Exhibit," displayed a small array of Special Collections from artist's books
      19th century volumes to facsimilies of illustrated manuscripts all relating to the themes of nature and climate change. For both exhibits, Cecelia researched, produced descriptive
      labels, and installed the exhibits.</p>
