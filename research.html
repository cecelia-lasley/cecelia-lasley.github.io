      <h4>“Collective Representation: 'Citizens' and 'Gentlemen' in Shakespeare’s <i>Richard III</i> and <i>Henry VIII</i>”</h4>
      <p>Capstone for Medieval and Renaissance Minor, Carleton College</p>
      <p class="sectionEnd">In addition to serving as the culminating, interdisciplinary capstone paper for the Medieval and Renaissance Studies Minor, this paper
      served as the final project for ENGL 310, "Shakespeare II," during the Winter 2019 trimester.This paper is comprised of research on the
      history of social structures during Shakespeare’s lifetime to shed light on how the use of otherwise unnamed “citizen” and “gentlemen”
      characters in Shakespeare’s <i>Richard III</i> and <i>Henry VIII</i> function as commoners in plays largely about aristocracy.</p>

      <h4>Public History research with Professor Sussannah Ottaway</h4>
      <p>Carleton College</p>
      <p class="sectionEndPage">Over the course of two classes and one summer research experience, Cecelia worked with Laird Bell Professor of History Susannah Ottaway
      as part of Professor Ottaway's ongoing work on English houses of industry. In the two classes, Cecelia co-designed a mini-game app for
      the museum’s tablet guides that is available to play at the museum as of Fall 2019 using Darwin software. During the summer research
      experience during the summer of 2018, Cecelia conducted archival research in Norwich with Professor Ottaway and two other Carleton students
      for one week and then the three students joined a fourth Carleton student at Gressenhall Farm and Workhouse Museum of Norfolk Life for two weeks.
      During that time, Cecelia worked with the other students to conduct a product test for new tablet guides at the museum, and she shadowed and
      collaborated with the museum’s curator, Dr. Megan Dennis to develop ideas for future exhibitions and events to complete steps to allow future
      projects to create 3D models of objects using Photogrammetry software.</p>
