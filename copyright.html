      <h3>About this website</h3><br>
      <p> This website was originally created by Cecelia Lasley as her final project for LIS 488, "Technology for Information Professionals"
        during the Spring 2021 semester.</p><br>

      <p>Acknowledgements: This site was visually inspired by <a href="http://www.fiftycoffees.com/">fiftycoffees.com</a>.
        Thank you to all of the former LIS 488 students who shared your websites at the 2021 "Lunch and Learn" event,
        especially Rebecca Anne Schmidt, Emma Lao, and Cassandra Wood. It was so helpful to see other successful projects
        as this one came together. Thank you also to Sarah Allwarden for her coding advice and troubleshooting
        assistance. Finally, thank you to Brennan Kuo for his coding advice, help with the dropdown menu (added Fall 2021), and troubleshooting
        assistance.</p><br>
