  <div id="aboutText">
      <p>Cecelia, who goes by Cece, uses she/her pronouns. She currently works at Washington & Jefferson College as the Instruction
        & Student Success Librarian at the Clark Family Library. She recently earned her MSLIS from Simmons University in May 2022.
        At Simmons, she concentrated in Cultural Heritage Informatics with a particular interest in the use of technology
        in the cultural heritage field. She earned a B.A. in English with a minor in Medieval and Renaissance Studies
        from Carleton College in June 2020.</p><br>
      <p>In her career, Cece aspires to collaborate with and educate patrons and other students about primary sources and
        Primary Source Literacy, and to work to expand access to historic and unique materials, particularly for communities
        who historically have not felt welcome in cultural heritage institutions. Cece aims to promote Information Literacy in her
        career because she feels that it is part of a core set of skills that users need in order to successfully navigate the rich
        and complex information landscape of the 21st century. Primary Source Literacy is a different form of Information Literacy that
        she is equally dedicated to in her work because she feels that it is a necessary skillset for anyone interested in
        working with and learning from historic materials and contemporary primary sources.</p><br>

        her resume</a>.</p><br>
      <p>Outside of her career, Cece is a Shakespeare and Tolkien nerd who loves to bake and spend time with her dog, Mia.
        A Marylander at heart, she loves spending time outside by the water. Her other hobbies include digital photography, West Coast
        Swing dance, and embroidery.</p>
