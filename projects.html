      <h3>Creative Commons Buzzword Project</h3>
      <p>This handout was created as a project for LIS 488,"Technology for Information Professionals," during the Spring 2021 semester.

      and explaining it to the other students in the class. Cecelia chose Creative Commons because she is interested in open access and scholarly
      communications, and Creative Commons is a related topic.</p><br>

      <h3>Open Educational Resources (OER) and Pressbooks Tutorial</h3>
      <p>This tutorial was created by Bailey Bader, Cecelia Lasley, and Rebekah Taylor for LIS 488,"Technology for Information Professionals,"
      during the Spring 2021 semester. The assignment was to develop a tutorial for the other students in the class on a technology about
      which the group did not know much. This group chose OER because they were all interested in exploring a different kind of educational

      and created a sample OER that summarizes their research about OER.</p><br>
