      <h3 class="Overview"> Simmons University Library Graduate Student Worker Independent Projects - Overview</h3>
      <p>During the 2021-2022 academic year, Cecelia worked as a Graduate Student worker providing reference assistance to the Simmons community
      and mentoring undergraduate and newer MSLIS students. Beyond her reference work, Cecelia also completed two other projects:
      designing and implementing a taxonomy for tagging reference chats and creating a dashboard to display the results of the tagging data
      in collaboration with User Services Librarian, Brian Arrigo; and poducing a series of short tutorial videos to support the teaching and learning
      opportunities presented in chat reference. Cecelia worked under the supervision of User Services Librarian, Brian Arrigo.</p>

      <h3>"Library How-Tos: Frequently Asked Questions" Video Series</h3>
      <p>This video series includes 5 short tutorial videos designed to answer frequently asked chat reference questions produced during the Spring 2022 semester.
      These questions were gleaned from the chat data produced by Cecelia's project with Brian Arrigo, as well as anectodal data from the experience of several
      graduate student workers (including Cecelia). The videos are designed to serve as teaching tools to accompany the answers provided by graduate student
      workers to patrons' chat reference questions. The videos are hosted on the Simmons Library's YouTube Channel in a playlist.
