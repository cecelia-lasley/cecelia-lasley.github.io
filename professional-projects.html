      <h3 class="Overview">Instruction and Student Success Librarian - Overview </h3>
      <p> In her role as the Instruction and Student Success Librarian at Washington & Jefferson College's ("W&J") Clark Family Library, Cecelia's primary
      responsibilities are to coordinate the instruction, reference, and outreach programs for the library. In addition, she liaises with the
      Computer and Information Studies, English, First Year Seminar, Philosophy, Physical Activity and Wellness, Poltiical Science, and Public Service
      and Community Studies (Public Policy and Sociology) departments. Below are some examples of her work in instruction, reference, and outreach.</p>

      <h3>English Composition Information Literacy Initative</h3>
      <p>In the Fall 2022 semester, Cecelia and several colleagues began an academic year-long pilot program to incorporate information literacy instruction
      into English Composition (W&Jâ€™s equivalent of first-year writing) courses. This initiative was in response to limited student retention of information
      literacy skills from First Year Seminar ("FYS") instruction. Librarians believe that much of this lack of retention was due to the fact that the FYS
      courses are mostly focused on getting students used to college-level work and life at W&J, and so there were not a lot of opportunities for students
      to practice the information literacy skills discussed in library instruction sessions in that particular course. <br>
      The English Composition instruction sessions encompassed a wide range of basic information literacy concepts from topic and keyword development, search
      strategies for popular library databases, and critical and contextual source evaluation. Sessions were designed in consultation with faculty
      accompanying an assignment. The assignments in English Composition are more traditional research projects compared to the First Year Seminar assignments,
      and so the library hoped that those assignments would make it easier for the students to apply the information literacy skills discussed in our sessions.
      This program took off beyond the library's hopes, thanks to the enthusiasm of the English department chair and the adjunct instructors who teach the
      majority of the English Composition classes. We were able to visit all but one or two sections in the Fall semester and visited all sections in the
      Spring semester.</p>
      <p>Learn more about this initiative in Cecelia's April 2023 blog post for the Pennsylvania Library Associatoin's "It's Academic!" blog below or 
      her webinar for the "Connect and Communicate" webinar series on the <a href="research.html" target="_blank">Research page</a>.</p>

      <h3>Research Guide Revamp</h3>
      <p>When Cecelia arrived at W&J, she was informed that most of the research guides had not been updated beyond link maintenance since c. 2016.
      Cecelia researched current best practices for subject guides, created and advocated for a revised style guide, and developed new subject guide skeletons
      to assist her colleagues in the reviison of subject guides. She also built the subject guides for her liaison areas and worked with faculty to ensure that
      the content fit with their curricula. For an example of the revised style guides, please visit
      <a href="https://libguides.washjeff.edu/cis" target="_blank">the guide for Computing and Information Studies</a>.</p>

      <h3>First Folio 400th Anniversary Exhibit</h3>
      <p>To celebrate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's First Folio, Cecelia combined her interests in Shakespeare and historic matierals with her work
      in outreach through a small exhibit on the Library's main floor about the First Folio and book structures. Cecelia collaborated with the College Archivist to
      display examples of a folio, quarto, and octavo from the Learned T. Bulman '48 Historic Archives & Museum's collections. The exhibit also included a
      "Make Your Own Folio" activity that visitors could do and then take home with them as a way to keep learning about both the First Folio and book strucutres.
      Cecelia also invited Shakespeare courses to come visit the exhibit to learn more about a different part of Shakespeare studies.

      <h3 class="Overview">Simmons University Library Graduate Student Worker Independent Projects - Overview</h3>
      <p>During the 2021-2022 academic year, Cecelia worked as a Graduate Student worker providing reference assistance to the Simmons community
      and mentoring undergraduate and newer MSLIS students. Beyond her reference work, Cecelia also completed two other projects:
      designing and implementing a taxonomy for tagging reference chats and creating a dashboard to display the results of the tagging data
      in collaboration with User Services Librarian, Brian Arrigo; and poducing a series of short tutorial videos to support the teaching and learning
      opportunities presented in chat reference. Cecelia worked under the supervision of User Services Librarian, Brian Arrigo.</p>

      <h3>"Library How-Tos: Frequently Asked Questions" Video Series</h3>
      <p>This video series includes 5 short tutorial videos designed to answer frequently asked chat reference questions produced during the Spring 2022 semester.
      These questions were gleaned from the chat data produced by Cecelia's project with Brian Arrigo, as well as anectodal data from the experience of several
      graduate student workers (including Cecelia). The videos are designed to serve as teaching tools to accompany the answers provided by graduate student
      workers to patrons' chat reference questions. The videos are hosted on the Simmons Library's YouTube Channel in a playlist.
